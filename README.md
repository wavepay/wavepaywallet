### The Wavepay

Wavepay is a POW/POS mineable cryptocurrency with Masternodes, based on a secure x11 algorithm.

Wavepay is dependent upon libsecp256k1 by sipa, the sources for which can be found here: https://github.com/bitcoin/secp256k1

Wavepay includes an Address Index feature, based on the address index API (searchrawtransactions RPC command) implemented in Bitcoin Core but modified implementation to work with the Wavepay codebase (PoS coins maintain a txindex by default for instance).

Initialize the Address Index By Running with -reindexaddr Command Line Argument. It may take 10-15 minutes to build the initial index.
